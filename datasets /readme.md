## Dataset Information

The datasets used in this project are sourced from public learning material provided by **Data with Baraa**.
They are used strictly for educational and demonstration purposes. The focus of this project is on data warehouse design, SQL transformations,
data modeling and analytics rather than data collection. Where CRM data represents customer master information and ERP data represents product and sales transactions.

## Acknowledgement

I would like to thank **Data with Baraa** for his guidance and structured approach that inspired me for this project. His concepts around modern data warehousing, Medallion Architecture and best practices in analytics engineering were extremely helpful for me in shaping this implementation.
